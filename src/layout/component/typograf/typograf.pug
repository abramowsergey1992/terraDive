		h2 During the first days of work, was discovered a bright object on the slope south of Khafraankh's tomb. 
		p The diffraction picture (radio image) showed that there might be an object (tomb) in this place at a depth of 5-6 meters, consisting of two "rooms" with dimensions of approximately 2.5 x 4 meters. After three days of excavation, “false” doors of the sought-for object appeared under the stone canopy (11/19/06).

In the first case the drilling method may lead to speeding up the process, in the second case – to the destruction of constructions.

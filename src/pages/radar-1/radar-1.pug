							h2 IGeoradars of the LOZA series belong to the class of geophysical instruments for studying the subsurface structure of the soil at depths of one to hundreds of meters, depending on the model of the device used and the parameters of the probed medium.
						.t-desc__right.text
							p The principle of operation of radars is based on the emission of ultra-wideband electromagnetic pulses without a carrier into the underlying medium and the registration of their reflections from the interface of layers or objects.

						.h1 Model "M".
						.h2 The simplest model, which does not require a highly qualified operator, is the Neo-dowser model. 
						p In this model, only threshold signal processing is provided, without registration of the wave function, which is sufficient to solve most practical problems in engineering-geological surveys and archeology. Information is presented on the screen in binary mode when two adjustable thresholds are exceeded, a binary profile is recorded in memory when three thresholds are exceeded in parallel.
						.h1  Model "B".
						.h2 In comparison with the Neo-dowser-M radar, the Neo-dowsermodification allows, additionally, to register the full waveform of the reflected pulse. The "B" model is focused on performing complex engineering-geological surveys and archaeological surveys using reflected signal amplitude analysis and "3-D" processing.
						p In this model, only threshold signal processing is provided, without registration of the wave function, which is sufficient to solve most practical problems in engineering-geological surveys and archeology. Information is presented on the screen in binary mode when two adjustable thresholds are exceeded, a binary profile is recorded in memory when three thresholds are exceeded in parallel.
						.h1 Model "N".
						.h2  "Neo-dowser-N" is a low-frequency version of the GPR "Neo-dowser-V", in which the lower frequency of the operating range is reduced to 25 MHz.
						p The response registration time has been increased to 2048 nsec. The readability of the data has a value of 2 or 4 ns. The Loza-N georadar is equipped with antennas with a central frequency of 25 MHz (length 600 cm), 50 MHz (length 300 cm) and 100 MHz (length 150 cm). The antennas (600 and 300 cm long) are folded like an accordion and can be transported in a bag with dimensions (100 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm). With the help of GPR "LOZA-N", it is possible to study the geological structure of the soil, approximately, to a depth of 100 meters (depending on the absorbing properties of the soil).

		h2 A distinctive feature of the devices of this series, in comparison with well-known foreign and domestic analogues, is a large energy potential that allows working in environments with high conductivity, for example in loam or wet clay, which is not possible for other geradars due to their small potential.
		p In order to achieve high energy performance, the classical radar construction scheme was completely revised, which usually uses a transistor transmitter with a voltage of about 50 V and a stroboscopic conversion to register reflected signals. Thus, the pulse power of the transmitter was increased by more than 10,000 times, and the stroboscopic conversion was replaced by direct recording of the signal, without converting it to the low frequency region. Resistively loaded dipoles are used as antennas (or their main radiating elements) in GPR radars of the LOZA series. This ensures that there is no "ringing" in the received signal, which, for example, is always present in the most common "butterfly" type antennas in the world.

		p This avoids connecting lines, and, therefore, strong leads from the transmitter (note that even the optical fiber used to synchronize the transmitter in the world's best radar samples is a waveguide). Synchronization of the receiver in the GPR "Loza" occurs by an air wave, which imposes some features during the operation of the device. In particular, in cases where it is necessary to work near the transmitters of telecentres, it is necessary to change the synchronization threshold in order to avoid additional interference. The independent design of the transmitter and receiver allows for "probing", i.e. the construction of a hodograph when the receiving and transmitting points are spaced. This method is the main one for determining the true depth of a layer or object, as well as the pulse propagation velocity, i.e. the parameters of the medium itself. The removable antennas of the receiver and transmitter can be quickly changed, thereby changing the operating frequency range of the radar, which is most often necessary under the conditions of a specific task. In most of the world's samples, antennas are structurally connected to the transmitter and receiver, and most often do not allow changing their relative spatial position, which excludes the possibility of constructing a hodograph.
